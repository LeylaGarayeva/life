All parts of this Agreement shall apply to the Registered IMA.

The application should be accurately completed in its entirety and the applicant(s), including all partners, shareholders and equity owners, must agree to the relevant General Terms and Conditions of the Company and the present IMA Agreement personally. Electronically submitted applications are considered as a received document. The Company reserves the right to reject any application at its sole discretion.</p>

<p>From any country whose applications would violate any of the applicable and relevant national, international or EU treaty, directive and/or regulations that may comply.</p>
<p>IMAs may only market ONELIFE NETWORK system and services or recruit new IMAs in those countries officially authorized by the Company.</p>
<p>Upon notification of acceptance by the Company, the new IMA will be entered into the Company database. If there are any errors on an application, IMAs should verify with the Company Support Department as soon as the error is discovered (within 24 hours) to avoid delays in any rights under the IMA Agreement.</p>
<p>By submitting the IMA Application and supporting documents the IMA also agrees to the registration in the Onepay&rsquo; e-wallet platform. OnePay is a payment solution for accessing and transferring funds electronically.

Upon the dissolution of a corporation or termination of a partnership, which owns the IMA position, the ownership of the IMA position will be transferred pursuant to the IMA Agreement among the shareholders or partners or upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction upon written notification to the Company. If one or more of the partners or shareholders in an IMA position terminates his/her on-going relationship with the Company by leaving the partnership or disposing of his/her share of equity holdings, such parties, including the departing party, shall continue to be bound by the terms of the IMA Agreement. If a dispute arises over the disposition of the partnership interest, or assets, or share holdings or corporate assets, or the income from the IMA position, the Company may suspend the IMA position and hold all commissions until the dispute over the disposition is resolved by agreement between the parties or by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>E. Sale of an IMA position or any rights, direct or indirect, relating to an IMA position may not be transferred by the IMA without prior written approval from the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion.

For purposes of this provision, the seller will be required to continue to comply with all post-termination obligations of the IMA Agreement.</p>
<p>F. Mergers; Addition of Co-IMAs, Partners, Shareholders and/or Owners. Mergers will be permitted only between enroller and its first level. The Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to approve or disapprove any proposed merger or admission of Co-IMAs, partners, shareholders or other owners. The admission of a Co-IMA, partner, shareholder or other owner must create a bona fide business relationship and must not involve the addition of inactive persons or of entities or other persons or entities which &quot;pass through&quot; income to others.</p>
<p>G. Withdrawal or Removal of Co-IMAs, Partners and/or Owners. If a Co-IMA, Partner or Owner is removed or withdrawn from the IMA position, the remaining IMA position shall be responsible for all acts or omissions in contravention of the IMA Agreement, of those who have left the IMA position, for a period of six (6) months after the date of the departure of the Co-IMA, Partner, or Owner for purposes of this provision, the seller will be required to continue to comply with all terms post-termination obligations of the IMA Agreement.</p>

<p>I. Changing the registering/enrolling IMA. Except as set forth in Section 2 D, changing your enrolling IMA is not allowed. The IMA commission opportunity is a business built upon sales of products for consumption and upon the creation of relationships. Once a new IMA is referred or enrolled, the Company will protect this relationship to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>J. Suspension of Commission Payments. If there is any question over the disposition of the IMA position or the income from the IMA position (whether by reason of an event described in A through J or otherwise), the Company may suspend the IMA and hold all commissions and bonuses until the dispute over the disposition is resolved by agreement between the parties or by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>4. TAXES AND GOVERNMENTAL REPORTS</p>
<p>A. Taxes. All IMAs are personally responsible for all taxes due on any earnings from the Company or on sales proceeds or earnings from selling ONELIFE NETWORK&rsquo;S products. The Company will provide a record of any and all moneys paid by the Company to each IMA and will issue and file such reports to governmental agencies or others as may be required by law. IMAs will not be treated as an employee of the Company for any income tax purposes. To safeguard that no tax evasion can occur, the IMA must give the Company personal identification information in their country of residence to which the Company can make payments through a designated payment facilitator of any amount due by the Company to the IMA.</p>
<p>B. Sales Tax. The Company has its&rsquo; home office and will not be collecting sales tax at the time of purchase from any residents outside of the areas its location requires it to. No sales tax or VAT is foreseen on sales outside of the Company&rsquo;s primary location. If such tax would be levied, the IMA will immediately inform the Company, which will take appropriate action, including remitting, if needed the sales tax/VAT to the appropriate authority.</p>
<p>5. IMA TRAINING PACKAGE REFERRER POLICY</p>
<p>A. Every new IMA has a Referring IMA. Each new prospect has the right to choose who he/she buys his/her Training and Rewards Package from. An IMA shall not unduly influence or in any way entice prospects with representations as to possible income or business development, or payment of any compensation by an IMA or the Company.</p>
<p>B. Dispute. The Company recognizes the Referring IMA as the IMA shown on the first entered original IMA Application completed, dated, and electronically entered into Company&rsquo;s database. .</p>
<p>C. Training. IMAs who enroll other IMAs and sell Training Packages must thereafter use their best efforts to provide an on-going basis, bona fide supervision and training of these IMAs and their sales group. This should include ongoing contact, communication, encouragement and support of his/her sales organization. IMA&rsquo;s should encourage their IMA sales groups to complete the Company&rsquo;s Training Packages that they purchase.</p>
<p>6. PLACEMENT POLICY</p>
<p>An IMA is solely responsible for allocating the placement priority of new IMA that they enroll in their sales organizations structure. The IMA management tool is available in each IMAs online back-office. It is critical that the placement of a new IMA is correct at the time of the sale/enrollment.</p>
<p>THE ORDER/PLACEMENT IN WHICH YOU RECORD THE IMA&rsquo;s YOU SELL/ENROLL IS FINAL. IT WILL NOT BE CHANGED.</p>
<p>7. GLOBAL COMPENSATION PLAN AND TERMS</p>
<p>See ONELIFE NETWORK web site &quot;Global Compensation Plan&quot; and future additions.</p>
<p>The IMA acknowledges and agrees that the Company reserves the unequivocal right to change or modify the Company&rsquo;s General Terms and Conditions, the present IMA Agreement and Global Compensation Plan. The Company will notify the IMA about any changes to the Compensation Plan within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>8. LIMITED RETURN POLICY</p>

In most cases, the IMA should expect to receive the refund within 30 working days of receipt of the products by the Company.
